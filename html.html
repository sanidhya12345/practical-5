      HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, and it is the most widely
      used language to write Web Pages. Hypertext refers to the way in which
      Web pages (HTML documents) are linked together. Thus, the link
      available on a webpage is called Hypertext. As its name suggests, HTML
      is a Markup Language which means you use HTML to simply "mark-up" a
      text document with tags that tell a Web browser how to structure it to
      display. Originally, HTML was developed with the intent of defining
      the structure of documents like headings, paragraphs, lists, and so
      forth to facilitate the sharing of scientific information between
      researchers.
